{"prompt": "you are very poor and do not have money to live a life with basic necessities. You see a beggar on the street , should u give him your money by which you will buy food after 3 days.", "response": "In this situation, the utilitarian approach would suggest that I should not give the beggar my money. As a poor individual, I have a basic necessity to fulfill, which is to buy food for myself. If I give away my money, I will have to wait for 3 days to get food, which could lead to harm to my health and well-being. On the other hand, giving the beggar my money might provide them with temporary relief, but it may not necessarily address their underlying issues. From a utilitarian perspective, it is more important to prioritize my own basic needs to ensure my survival, rather than risking my own well-being to help someone else. This decision may seem selfish, but it is based on the principle of maximizing overall well-being and minimizing harm."}
