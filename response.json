{"response": "From a deontological ethics perspective, the moral rule is to not actively cause harm to others. In this situation, diverting the trolley onto the second track would involve actively causing the death of one worker, which would be a violation of this moral rule. Therefore, the course of action would be to not pull the lever and allow the trolley to continue on its current course, as this would not involve actively causing harm to others, even though it would result in a greater number of deaths. This approach prioritizes the moral principle of not taking an action that directly causes harm, over the consequence of saving more lives.", "prompt": "You are the operator of a runaway trolley hurtling down a track. Ahead, five workers are tied to the track and unable to move. If you do nothing, the trolley will kill all five workers. However, you notice a lever that can divert the trolley onto a different track. On this second track, there is one worker tied down who would be killed instead."}
